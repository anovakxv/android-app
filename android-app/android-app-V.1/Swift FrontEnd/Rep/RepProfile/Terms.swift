                Welcome to Rep. By continuing, you agree to the following community guidelines and terms:
                
                1. Community Standards
                Users must not post objectionable, offensive, or abusive content.
                Hate speech, harassment, and explicit material are strictly prohibited.
                Violators may have their content removed and accounts suspended or banned.

                2. User Responsibilities
                You are solely responsible for the content you share, create, or promote.
                Impersonation, deception, or targeted harassment is not tolerated.

                3. Moderation & Enforcement
                Rep reserves the right to monitor, moderate, and remove content at its discretion.
                Inappropriate content can be flagged by users and reviewed by our team.
                Users can block others to prevent unwanted or abusive interactions.

                4. Removal of Objectionable Content    
                We will review flagged content and remove content that violates this policy within 24 hours of the content being flagged. Users who repeatedly violate our content policy will be ejected from the platform. 

                5. Intellectual Property
                Rep and its underlying software, design, content, trademarks, logos, and features are the exclusive property of Networked Capital Inc., unless otherwise noted.
                Users are not permitted to modify, reverse-engineer, reproduce, distribute, or exploit any part of the app or its codebase without prior written consent.
                All feedback, suggestions, or feature ideas submitted by users may be used by Networked Capital Inc. to improve Rep, with no obligation of compensation unless explicitly agreed upon.
                Unauthorized use of Repâ€™s intellectual property may result in termination of service and legal action.

                6. Future Licensing
                Certain components of Rep may, in the future, be released under an open-source license. However, until such licensing is explicitly announced and documented by Networked Capital Inc., all elements of the Rep software remain proprietary and fully protected under applicable intellectual property laws. Future licensing decisions will not retroactively affect ownership rights, nor shall they be construed as a waiver of any current protections.

                7. Agreement
                By using Rep, you acknowledge and agree to uphold these standards.
