# Rep Android App

An Android social networking application for representatives, converted from the original Swift iOS app. The app helps "Reps" connect, set goals, create portals for collaboration, and communicate with their network.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Registration, login, and onboarding flow
- **Profile Management**: Complete user profiles with skills, location, and bio

- **Goals Tracking**: Individual and team goal management with progress visualization
- **Real-time Messaging**: Direct communication between users
- **Content Sharing**: Image uploads and story creation
- **Network Building**: Connect with other representatives

## Architecture

The app follows modern Android development practices:

- **MVVM Architecture** with Repository pattern
- **Jetpack Compose** for modern, declarative UI
- **Dagger Hilt** for dependency injection
- **Room Database** for local data persistence
- **Retrofit** with **Moshi** for API communication
- **Coil** for efficient image loading
- **Material 3** design system
- **Navigation Compose** for type-safe navigation

## Tech Stack

### Core
- Kotlin
- Jetpack Compose
- Android Architecture Components (ViewModel, LiveData, Room)
- Kotlin Coroutines & Flow

### Networking
- Retrofit 2
- OkHttp
- Moshi (JSON parsing)

### Dependency Injection

### Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in Android Studio
3. Update the API base URL in `ApiConfig.kt`
4. Sync the project and install dependencies
5. Run the app on an emulator or physical device

### Backend Configuration

Update the base URL in `app/src/main/java/com/networkedcapital/rep/data/api/ApiConfig.kt`:

```kotlin
const val BASE_URL = "https://your-backend-url.com/"
```
