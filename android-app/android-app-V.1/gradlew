#   Gradle start up script for POSIX generated by Gradle.
#
#   Important for running:
#
#   (1) You will need a POSIX-compliant shell to run this script. If your /bin/sh is
#       naplevel shell instead of sh, or is not POSIX-compliant, you may need to execute
#       this script with an alternative shell:
#       sh ./gradlew
#
#   (2) Don't worry, the wrapper will download Gradle for you automatically.
